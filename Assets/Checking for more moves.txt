Only check part that changed? Could be risky since player may have chosen 1 possible match over another.

Start from position 0,0.
In coroutine.
 Check for possible matches when moving 1 up, down, left, right and then seeing if moving 1 more in that direction is another tile of same type, if so , check one more in same direction. If so then there are still possible matches and you can exit the loop knowing the player can still continue.
This works because the minimum match is three in a row and all the match shapes are designed to contain at least 1 row of 3 in either a vertical or horizontal orientation.

Since starting from the bottom left certain optimizations can be made. 
1. At the top and right hand edge, there is no need to check to the right or top.
same applies for left bottom. May be possible to only start checking from 1,1 instead of 0,0. Need to think this through.
2.
 
If no matches are found after checking the whole board, then do a shuffle.
